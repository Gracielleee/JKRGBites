Privacy Policy for JRKGBites

Last Updated: January 14, 2026

This Privacy Policy describes how JRKGBites collects, uses, and stores your information when you use our mobile application.

1. Information We Collect

We collect the following types of information:

a) Information You Provide:
- Account Information: When you create an account, we collect your email address, password, and preferred name.
- Usage Information: We store your preferences, such as your list of "Favorite" and "Never Again" restaurants, and any ratings you submit.

b) Information Collected Automatically:
- Device Feature Information: Our Service uses your device's accelerometer to enable the "shake-to-pick" feature. This motion data is processed on your device and is not stored or transmitted.
- Biometric Information: If you choose to enable biometric login (e.g., fingerprint), the app uses the Android Biometric system to authenticate you. We do not collect, store, see, or transmit your biometric data (e.g., your fingerprint data) at any time. All biometric data remains securely stored on your device and is managed by the Android operating system.

2. How We Use Your Information

We use the information we collect to:
- Provide, operate, and maintain our Service.
- Manage your account and your personal preferences.
- Personalize your experience by tailoring restaurant suggestions based on your swipes and ratings.

3. How We Store Your Information

All information related to your account and preferences is stored locally on your device. The current version of the application uses a "fake" authentication service for development purposes and does not transmit your personal data to a remote server.

4. Third-Party Services

JRKGBites does not use any third-party services for analytics, advertising, or data collection.

5. Data Security

We take reasonable measures to protect the information stored on your device. However, no method of storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

6. Children's Privacy

Our Service is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13.

7. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy within the application. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
